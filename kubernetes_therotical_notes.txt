MASTER:
1)kube-apiserver: For communication of all objects in cluster.
2)ETCD: Has all the latest upadets of whats going on in the cluster. ditributed key value store.Represents the state of a cluster at a specific moment in time.
3)Controller-Manager: Checks the status of all the nodes and pods, all services.Checks on which node the pod cn be schedules.
                      responsible for maintaing the desired stable state of the cluster.
4)kube-scheduler: Schedule PODs according to available resources on executor nodes.

WORKER:
1)kubelet: kubelet runs on each node, Agent for managing and communicating with the master.Controls and maintains a set of pods by watching for pod specs through  the         Kubernetes API server.
2)kube-proxy: kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in your cluster, implementing part of the Kubernetes Service concept. kube-proxy maintains network rules on nodes. These network rules allow network communication to your Pods from network sessions inside or outside of your cluster.
